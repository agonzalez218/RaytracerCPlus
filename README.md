# RaytracerCPlus
I created my own raytracer in C++. It has shadows, reflections, and transformations.

The Raytracer was created using OpenGL in C++.

The following image is an example scene that shows reflections, shadows, and transformations:

The following image is a scene I created on my own showing three spheres, each reflecting and showing shadows on each other:

The Raytracer works by supplying it with a scene file, then it generates the image of the scene from the view and parameters specified.

The two scenes shown above are included in the Github repository with extensions .scn
